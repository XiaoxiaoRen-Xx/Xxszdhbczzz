# Portfolio
Hiiiii, this is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU Heinz College! Here's where all my cool work will go. You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  I am Xiaoxiao Ren from MEIM!üöÄ Honestly, I'm not very skilled at data processing, but I genuinely believe that mastering data-related knowledge is really cool! Learning how to visualize data, in particular, is an incredibly versatile skill. I'm very excited about the growth I will achieve after taking this course!üéÅ

# What I hope to learn
Hey, I list 3 things I hope I can learn and achieve, check them out! 

**1. Becoming a Pre-Master of "Telling Stories with Data" üòé** 

I absolutely love taking photos because every picture has a story behind it. That's why I want to learn how to "tell stories with data"‚Äîjust like capturing a journey through a photo! I want to use the right datasets and tools to turn complex information into visuals that are easy to understand and fun to look at. Imagine talking to friends about data and hearing them say, "Wow, this visualization makes it so easy to understand. You're a genius for doing it this way!" (Yes, I love compliments, haha!)

**2. Improving My Critical Thinking Skills üìã**

In the past, I often found myself speechless when others shared their ideas or suggestions. I‚Äôd easily go along with their opinions, thinking, "Well, they must have a good reason for doing it that way." Through this course, I want to change that and become someone who can spot issues in charts at a glance. Not only will I be able to point out problems, but I‚Äôll also come up with practical solutions. For example, when someone uses a chaotic pie chart to present data, I can gracefully suggest, "You know, a bar chart would actually make this much clearer!"

**3. Creating My Own "Showcase of Work"ü™©**

I've often heard people talk about GitHub, but I always thought it was exclusive to those who are great at coding or data analysis. Now, I‚Äôm excited to finally step into that world and create a cool online portfolio through this course‚Äîlike my own personal art exhibit! I can‚Äôt wait to show it off to my family because, just like me, they‚Äôve always been intimidated by these things. But hey, I‚Äôm facing my fears and making progress, right?

## Assignment 1: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 


- [Visualizing Government Debt: First Try!](https://xiaoxiaoren-xx.github.io/visualizing-government-debt/)

- [Visualizing Government Debt: Second Try!- A Decade of Gov Debt in North America (2003-2013)](https://xiaoxiaoren-xx.github.io/visualizing_Gov_Debt_Trend/)

**-Explanation of My Final Redesign-**

When I first looked at the dataset, I was overwhelmed by the number of countries and years it covered.   I knew I needed to narrow it down to something more focused.   So, I decided to analyze North America, which includes the United States, Canada, and Mexico. These three countries not only share a geographic region but also represent distinct economic scales and fiscal policies.   Comparing them felt like an interesting way to showcase their similarities and differences over time.

For the redesign, I specifically chose the years 2003 to 2013 because first of all, it's a decade so it will be fun to see what change happened in this decade, and also this period includes significant economic events like the 2008 financial crisis (I only know the name and time of this incident). So I wanted to see how government debt levels changed during this time and whether each country had similar trends. The line chart format was an easy decision because it‚Äôs perfect for showing changes over time. Compared to the heatmap I created in Part 2, the line chart feels much more dynamic and tells a clearer story about trends and relationships.

In terms of design, each country has its own color, making it easy to follow their individual trail. I also labeled the axes clearly and used a meaningful title to ensure that the chart stands alone without needing too much extra context.

**-Why This Chart Works-**

The line chart allows viewers to instantly grasp the differences in debt levels between these three countries. For example, the U.S. debt levels show a dramatic spike after 2008, likely reflecting its response to the financial crisis. Canada‚Äôs debt, on the other hand, grew at a steadier rate. Meanwhile, Mexico‚Äôs debt levels remained significantly lower, highlighting the differences in the country‚Äôs management.

Compared to the heatmap, which felt a bit static, this chart is more direct and intuitive. The heatmap was helpful for comparing multiple countries at once, but it lacked the ability to highlight trends over time.

**-My Thought Process-**

I wanted to create a visualization that was both informative and easy to read. Once I landed on the line chart, it all started to work. I‚Äôm really happy with how it turned out, and I hope others find it as interesting as I do!  
(First try on Tableau was a disasterü´¢ but I'm happy I can figure it out and start to create on my ownüòé)

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.

### Adding images

Tips: Remember to upload the image into repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else. 



## Things I will probably use in the future

**For some title, hey-- remember the space!**
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

 

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
