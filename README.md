# Portfolio
Hiiiii, this is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU Heinz College! Here's where all my cool work will go. You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  I am Xiaoxiao Ren from MEIM!üöÄ Honestly, I'm not very skilled at data processing, but I genuinely believe that mastering data-related knowledge is really cool! Learning how to visualize data, in particular, is an incredibly versatile skill. I'm very excited about the growth I will achieve after taking this course!üéÅ

# What I hope to learn
Hey, I list 3 things I hope I can learn and achieve, check them out! 

**1. Becoming a Pre-Master of "Telling Stories with Data" üòé** 

I absolutely love taking photos because every picture has a story behind it. That's why I want to learn how to "tell stories with data"‚Äîjust like capturing a journey through a photo! I want to use the right datasets and tools to turn complex information into visuals that are easy to understand and fun to look at. Imagine talking to friends about data and hearing them say, "Wow, this visualization makes it so easy to understand. You're a genius for doing it this way!" (Yes, I love compliments, haha!)

**2. Improving My Critical Thinking Skills üìã**

In the past, I often found myself speechless when others shared their ideas or suggestions. I‚Äôd easily go along with their opinions, thinking, "Well, they must have a good reason for doing it that way." Through this course, I want to change that and become someone who can spot issues in charts at a glance. Not only will I be able to point out problems, but I‚Äôll also come up with practical solutions. For example, when someone uses a chaotic pie chart to present data, I can gracefully suggest, "You know, a bar chart would actually make this much clearer!"

**3. Creating My Own "Showcase of Work"ü™©**

I've often heard people talk about GitHub, but I always thought it was exclusive to those who are great at coding or data analysis. Now, I‚Äôm excited to finally step into that world and create a cool online portfolio through this course‚Äîlike my own personal art exhibit! I can‚Äôt wait to show it off to my family because, just like me, they‚Äôve always been intimidated by these things. But hey, I‚Äôm facing my fears and making progress, right?


# Portfolio

## Assignment 1: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

### Adding images

Tips: Remember to upload the image into repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else. 



## Things I will probably use in the future

### Creating tables


| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)


**For some title, hey-- remember the space!**
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

 

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).

# TSWD-portfolio-templates
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference: 

- Web page URL: https://cmustudent.github.io/tswd-portfolio-templates/
- This repository: https://github.com/cmustudent/tswd-portfolio-templates/
