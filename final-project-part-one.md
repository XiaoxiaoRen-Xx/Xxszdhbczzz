# üìù Outline of Final Project

In this project, I aim to explore how to achieve healthy, sustainable weight loss while exposing the risks of extreme dieting. Like many others, I once believed that drastic calorie restriction‚Äîsurviving on coffee and cucumber‚Äîwas the fastest way to lose weight. While the scale drops quickly, the consequences soon follow: fatigue, muscle loss, metabolic slowdown, and inevitable weight regain.  

This issue extends beyond individual struggles; with obesity rates rising globally, many turn to extreme diets that promise fast results but rarely deliver lasting success. Instead of chasing unsustainable quick fixes, this project will break down the science behind effective weight loss. Using data-driven analysis and visual storytelling, I‚Äôll compare different diet methods, highlighting their impact on health in both the short and long term. More importantly, I‚Äôll provide practical insights to help individuals create personalized, sustainable weight-loss strategies that promote overall well-being, not just a lower number on the scale.


## üîç Setup: Where My Thought Came From?

Many of my friends have tried extreme diets‚Äîsurviving on coffee and a cucumber. The weight drops fast, but so does their energy, and focus, and eventually, all the weight comes back.  
This isn‚Äôt just personal; it‚Äôs a global issue. **Over 1 billion people worldwide are now classified as obese, and rates continue to rise. In desperation, many turn to crash diets, yet 95% fail, and over 75% regain the weight within 2-5 years.  
With obesity becoming a growing crisis, it‚Äôs time to rethink weight loss‚Äînot as a quick fix, but as a sustainable, science-backed approach that actually works.

## üî• Conflict: What are the problems?

Through research, I discovered that many popular diets are not scientifically sound and can harm health.
Very Low-Calorie Diets (VLCDs) cause rapid weight loss but also slow metabolism, reduce muscle mass, and increase health risks.
Short-term success, long-term failure: Over 75% of dieters regain weight, proving that extreme methods are unsustainable.
People choose these diets because they lack the right information. I want to use data visualization to compare different weight-loss methods and highlight the importance of sustainable, science-based approaches.

## ‚úÖ Resolution: How are we going to fix it?

The key to healthy weight loss is personalized, balanced nutrition scientifically. By calculating daily caloric needs based on height, weight, age, and activity level, people can lose weight effectively without harming their health.
In my project, I will compare the long-term effects of different diet strategies and provide an interactive tool that generates personalized nutrition plans. My goal is to help people understand that losing weight isn‚Äôt about eating less‚Äîit‚Äôs about eating right and sustainably!

> ### Data visualizations for the conflict stage
Thoughts: The method(s) is TBD.
1. Bar chart: Compare the success vs. failure rates of different fat loss methods (e.g., low-carb diet and balanced diet) in both short-term and long-term effects.
2. Heat map: Shows the short-term vs. long-term effects of different fat loss methods.

> ### Data visualizations for the resolution stage
Thoughts: The method(s) is TBD.
1. Simple chart: Show the optimal nutrient intake ratio for different body weights and exercise levels, allowing the audience can look for their own combinations based on their personal situations.


## The DATA

### üìä Global Obesity Rates 
Method: World map of 2016 and 2022, the comparisons indicating there is an increasing trend in obesity rate.
The World Obesity Federation‚Äôs 2024 report and the WHO Obesity Report highlight the alarming rise in global obesity rates, emphasizing the severity of the issue and the growing demand for effective weight-loss solutions.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Failure Rates & Health Risks of Extreme Dieting
Method: Bar chart or heat map, TBD.
Studies from the NIH (National Institutes of Health) and PubMed reveal that extreme dieting can lead to slowed metabolism, muscle loss, and hormonal imbalances. Worse, over 75% of people regain weight within 2-5 years, trapping them in a frustrating cycle of weight loss and rebound.

### ‚úÖ The Viability of Scientific Weight Loss
Method: A simple chart, like a table chart.
By referencing nutritional research and data from credible health influencers, I have compiled science-backed dietary strategies that help individuals create personalized, sustainable weight-loss plans‚Äîfree from the pitfalls of extreme dieting.

## üåê Method and medium 
As I process various sources and data, I continuously refine my data visualization choices. Currently, I plan to use Tableau to create different charts, such as **bar charts and heat maps**, to visually compare weight-loss methods. Additionally, I will design a clear, easy-to-navigate table. My first thought was through a shareable Excel spreadsheet, but now I just get to know Shortland is a great platform for me to build a visual narrative page for the audiences, allowing viewers to find relevant data and apply it to their own weight-loss journey, I will learn to figure out in the later stage. Finally, all content will be organized and published on GitHub to ensure clarity and accessibility.
