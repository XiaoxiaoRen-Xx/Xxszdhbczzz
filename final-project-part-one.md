# Outline

In this project, I aim to demonstrate how to achieve healthy weight loss through scientifically informed methods, while highlighting the risks of unsustainable and extreme dieting. In today’s world, many people, actually including me, upon noticing weight gain, often resort to drastic measures such as severely reducing calorie intake—sometimes as little as just two cups of coffee and a cucumber a day. While such approaches may result in rapid short-term weight loss, they frequently lead to significant long-term consequences, including slowed metabolism, muscle loss, hormonal imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies. Worse yet, these methods often result in the dreaded weight regain, leaving individuals trapped in an unhealthy cycle.

Through this project, I plan to use data-driven analysis and visual storytelling to help my audience understand why scientific weight loss is a more sustainable and healthier approach. By comparing the short-term effects, long-term risks, and health outcomes of different dietary methods, I will illustrate the importance of balanced nutrition. Additionally, I will provide actionable insights that allow viewers to design their own tailored weight-loss plans based on their unique needs. This project aims not only to improve individual health outcomes but also to raise public awareness about the importance of evidence-based dieting.


> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Setup: Where my thought came from?
Many of my friends have tried to lose weight by extreme dieting—drinking only coffee and eating a cucumber a day. While they saw quick results, they soon felt exhausted, lost focus, and ultimately regained all the weight, sometimes even more.

This is not an isolated issue—95% of diets fail, and over 75% of people regain the weight within 2-5 years. With obesity rates rising globally, many turn to fast weight-loss methods without considering long-term effects.

## Conflict: What are the problems?
Through research, I discovered that many popular diets are not scientifically sound and can harm health.

Very Low-Calorie Diets (VLCDs) cause rapid weight loss but also slow metabolism, reduce muscle mass, and increase health risks.
Short-term success, long-term failure: Over 75% of dieters regain weight, proving that extreme methods are unsustainable.
People choose these diets because they lack the right information. I want to use data visualization to compare different weight-loss methods and highlight the importance of sustainable, science-based approaches.

## Resolution: How are we going to fix it?
The key to healthy weight loss is personalized, balanced nutrition scientifically. By calculating daily caloric needs based on height, weight, age, and activity level, people can lose weight effectively without harming their health.

In my project, I will compare the long-term effects of different diet strategies and provide an interactive tool that generates personalized nutrition plans. My goal is to help people understand that losing weight isn’t about eating less—it’s about eating right and sustainably!
