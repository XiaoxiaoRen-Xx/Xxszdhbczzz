# 📝 Outline of Final Project

Version 1:

In this project, I aim to explore how to achieve healthy, sustainable weight loss while exposing the risks of extreme dieting. Like many others, I once believed that drastic calorie restriction—surviving on coffee and cucumber—was the fastest way to lose weight. While the scale drops quickly, the consequences soon follow: fatigue, muscle loss, metabolic slowdown, and inevitable weight regain.  

This issue extends beyond individual struggles; with obesity rates rising globally, many turn to extreme diets that promise fast results but rarely deliver lasting success. Instead of chasing unsustainable quick fixes, this project will break down the science behind effective weight loss. Using data-driven analysis and visual storytelling, I’ll compare different diet methods, highlighting their impact on health in both the short and long term. More importantly, I’ll provide practical insights to help individuals create personalized, sustainable weight-loss strategies that promote overall well-being, not just a lower number on the scale.

**Version 2: Final choice**

This is my second version of the explanation. Later, I realized that starting with the widespread misinformation on social media aligns better with my vision. From there, I gradually introduce how people, influenced by misleading information, have made many ineffective weight loss efforts. I want to help them, also just like I once needed help. By showing that they don’t need to starve themselves or resort to unhealthy methods to lose weight. In many cases, these extreme approaches backfire. This realization was the starting point of my project.

## 🔍 Setup: Where My Thought Came From?

Many of my friends have tried extreme diets—surviving on coffee and a cucumber. The weight drops fast, but so does their energy, and focus, and eventually, all the weight comes back.  
This isn’t just personal; it’s a global issue. Over 1 billion people worldwide are now classified as obese, and rates continue to rise. In desperation, many turn to crash diets, yet 95% fail, and over 75% regain the weight within 2-5 years.  
With obesity becoming a growing crisis, it’s time to rethink weight loss—not as a quick fix, but as a sustainable, science-backed approach that actually works.

## 🔥 Conflict: What are the problems?

Through research, I discovered that many popular diets are not scientifically sound and can harm health.
Very Low-Calorie Diets cause rapid weight loss but also slow metabolism, reduce muscle, and increase health risks.
Short-term success, long-term failure: Over 75% of dieters regain weight, proving that extreme methods are unsustainable.
People choose these diets because they lack the right information. I want to use data visualization to compare different weight-loss methods and highlight the importance of sustainable, science-based approaches.

## ✅ Resolution: How are we going to fix it?

The key to healthy weight loss is personalized, balanced nutrition scientifically. By calculating daily caloric needs based on height, weight, age, and activity level, people can lose weight effectively without harming their health.
In my project, I will compare the long-term effects of different diet strategies and provide an interactive tool that generates personalized nutrition plans. My goal is to help people understand that losing weight isn’t about eating less—it’s about eating right and sustainably!

❗️**Correction after this**❗️
Since I changed the direction of the introduction, these data visualizations can no longer be used. However, when I logged into my Datawrapper account, I'm so sorry that couldn't find my edit history and found that all my data visualization records were missing. 
I have already contacted Datawrapper’s support team via email. 
Fortunately, I still have access to the published URLs of my visualizations. Below are the links to my data visualizations—feel free to check them out!

### 📊 Data Visualizations

As part of my project, I created several data visualizations to illustrate key insights. You can view them through the links below:

> ### Data visualizations for the conflict stage
Thoughts: The method(s) is TBD.
1. Bar chart: Compare the success vs. failure rates of different fat loss methods (e.g., low-carb diet and balanced diet) in both short-term and long-term effects.
2. Heat map: Shows the short-term vs. long-term effects of different fat loss methods.

> ### Data visualizations for the resolution stage
Thoughts: The method(s) is TBD.
1. Simple chart: Show the optimal nutrient intake ratio for different body weights and exercise levels, allowing the audience can look for their own combinations based on their personal situations.


## The DATA

### 📊 Global Obesity Rates 
Method: World map of 2016 and 2022, the comparisons indicating there is an increasing trend in obesity rate.
The World Obesity Federation’s 2024 report and the WHO Obesity Report highlight the alarming rise in global obesity rates, emphasizing the severity of the issue and the growing demand for effective weight-loss solutions.

### ⚠️ Failure Rates & Health Risks of Extreme Dieting
Method: Bar chart or heat map, TBD.
Studies from the NIH (National Institutes of Health) and PubMed reveal that extreme dieting can lead to slowed metabolism, muscle loss, and hormonal imbalances. Worse, over 75% of people regain weight within 2-5 years, trapping them in a frustrating cycle of weight loss and rebound.

### ✅ The Viability of Scientific Weight Loss
Method: A simple chart, like a table chart.
By referencing nutritional research and data from credible health influencers, I want to create science-backed dietary strategies that help individuals create personalized, sustainable weight-loss plans—free from the pitfalls of extreme dieting.

## 🌐 Method and medium 
As I process various sources and data, I continuously refine my data visualization choices. Currently, I plan to use Tableau to create different charts, such as bar charts and heat maps, to visually compare weight-loss methods. Additionally, I will design a clear, easy-to-navigate table. My first thought was through a shareable Excel spreadsheet, but now I just get to know Shortland is a great platform for me to build a visual narrative page for the audiences, allowing viewers to find relevant data and apply it to their own weight-loss journey, I will learn to figure out in the later stage. Finally, all content will be organized and published on GitHub to ensure clarity and accessibility.

## AI acknowledgements
1. I encountered a lot of technical issues, such as I can see the charts in my preview section but can't be seen from the portfolio, so I went to ask ChatGPT to help me out. Also I had problems when I created the table, so I asked again.
2. I asked ChatGPT to help me revise my statements because I realized that there are some sentences I cannot express clearly, especially in the outline section, such as "This issue extends beyond individual struggles; with obesity rates rising globally, many turn to extreme diets that promise fast results but rarely deliver lasting success."
3. As for the data section, many articles contain highly specialized vocabulary, which makes it difficult for me to understand. So I copied some of the paragraphs I couldn't quite understand so I asked ChatGPT to help me interpret them.
4. In the Method and Medium section, I can only think of creating a simple table chart to show the data to the audiences, but I think it's boring and maybe not effective and attractive for the audiences. So I asked ChatGPT's advice and show me the new platform called "Shortland" may be helpful for this part of data visualization.



## The tips I want to save here
> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one-sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.
