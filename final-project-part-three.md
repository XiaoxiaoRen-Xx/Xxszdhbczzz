# Changes made since Part II

Since completing Part II, I have made several key refinements, aiming to improve clarity, engagement, and overall effectiveness.  

First, I enhanced the storytelling aspect to make the narrative more compelling. Originally, I had a lot of statistics and charts, honestly, I think they all can be useful and I really want to cover most of them, but they lacked sufficient context. To make the data more meaningful, I added different transitions and short paragraphs between every data visualization, real-life examples, and relatable explanations, such as starting by talking about common weight loss misconceptions, and how misinformation can negatively impact people’s health, then following by statistics and different data visualization to elaborate.  

Another major improvement was simplifying the explanation of scientific concepts. Some of the research findings were too technical for the general audience, so I rewrote them using simpler language and relatable analogies. For instance, instead of just stating food weights in grams, I provided familiar size comparisons that I do the scaling by myself, like "100g of beef is about the weight of a smartphone," making it easier to visualize portion sizes. This insight was inspired by one interviewer in the Part II interview which I found valuable.

Additionally, I refined the Call-to-Action (CTA) section. Rather than just providing a table for calculations, I now guide readers on how to use the table effectively and emphasize that it’s just a starting point. I also emphasized the message throughout the whole project is that starving yourself won't work!! Extreme dieting does not work and fueling the body properly is key to sustainable weight loss. I want my project to help the anxious people to fight with misinformation. 


## The audience

My primary audience consists of people interested in fat loss but misled by diet culture and social media trends. Many have been affected by toxic content from online and unrealistic examples, which caused them to attempt weight loss through extreme measures since they really want to see the changes, unaware of the scientific approach to sustainable fat loss. My goal is to correct these misconceptions and show them that they don’t have to starve themselves to achieve their goals, and help anxious people to fight against their struggles.  

To ensure relevance, I incorporated real experiences from my friends and online discussions, highlighting the content itself and people's struggles from different aspects, such as money spent, amount of attempts, and popular methods. To make people better understand and engage, I also created two personas representing different lifestyles, demonstrating how they could achieve fat loss in a smart way.  

To improve accessibility, I avoided technical jargon, and used engaging visuals with short explanations and transitions. Then I balanced data-driven insights with relatable examples. This makes the project more **reader-friendly and applicable to everyday life**.  


## Final design decisions

**Balancing data and storytelling for better engagement**

Instead of just listing facts, I structured the content as a journey. It starts with common weight loss myths, explains why extreme dieting fails, and then provides abetter, science-backed solution. This approach makes the information more engaging and easier to follow. Making it feel more like a story rather than just a report.

**Clear and impactful data visualization**

To make key statistics stand out, I used simple, eye-catching visuals. For example, the 95% diet failure rate is shown with a donut chart, making it instantly clear how small the success area and the common the issue is.  

**Turning information into action**

Rather than just providing a table, I included step-by-step instructions and a calculation example. This makes it easy for readers to apply the information and find their recommended intake without confusion and time wasting. Additionally, I emphasized this is just for a basic guide, since this is aim to convey the thought on "stop starving yourself to loss weight". For better individual customization, I encouraged readers to adjust their intake based on their needs.

**Simplifying science** 

Scientific explanations can be overwhelming, so I translated research into simple takeaways. I also used everyday comparisons, like “100g of beef is about the weight of a smartphone” to help readers visualize portion sizes effortlessly.  

**Creating a personal connection**  
To make the project feel relatable, I included real-life experiences, personas and common struggles people face with dieting. This reassures readers that they’re not alone and helps build trust in the information.  

**The Final Message I want to highlight!**  
With these improvements, the project is now clearer, more engaging, and easier to follow and use. The main takeaway is simple: You don’t have to starve to lose weight—eating right is the key!

Yayyyyyyyyyy!!

I'm really happy that I finished this project! I truly feel proud of myself. There were moments when this topic completely overwhelmed me—I hit roadblocks multiple times, struggling to figure out how to continue telling the story in a compelling way. I ended up scrapping and restructuring my ideas many times, refining my wording over and over to ensure that the final piece was both easy to read and crystal clear for the audience. 

Through this course, I’ve learned so many tools that I never thought I would use, and I’m incredibly grateful for both the class and the professor! (Even though the workload was definitely heavy, and I complained about it a lot haha sorry! But if I had to choose again, I’d still enroll in the waitlist over fifty people on it!)
