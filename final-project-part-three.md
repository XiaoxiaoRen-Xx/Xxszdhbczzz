# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

Since completing Part II, I have made several key refinements, aiming to improve clarity, engagement, and overall effectiveness.  

First, I enhanced the storytelling aspect to make the narrative more compelling. Originally, I had a lot of statistics and charts, honestly, I think they all can be useful and I really want to cover most of them, but they lacked sufficient context. To make the data more meaningful, I added different transitions and short paragraphs between every data visualization, real-life examples, and relatable explanations, such as starting by talking about common weight loss misconceptions, and how misinformation can negatively impact peopleâ€™s health, then following by statistics and different data visualization to elaborate.  

Another major improvement was simplifying the explanation of scientific concepts. Some of the research findings were too technical for the general audience, so I rewrote them using simpler language and relatable analogies. For instance, instead of just stating food weights in grams, I provided familiar size comparisons that I do the scaling by myself, like "100g of beef is about the weight of a smartphone," making it easier to visualize portion sizes. This insight was inspired by one interviewer in the Part II interview which I found valuable.

Additionally, I refined the Call-to-Action (CTA) section. Rather than just providing a table for calculations, I now guide readers on how to use the table effectively and emphasize that itâ€™s just a starting point. I also emphasized the message throughout the whole project is that starving yourself won't work!! Extreme dieting does not work and fueling the body properly is key to sustainable weight loss. I want my project to help the anxious people to fight with misinformation.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

My primary audience consists of people interested in fat loss but misled by diet culture and social media trends. Many have been affected by toxic content from online and unrealistic examples, which caused them to attempt weight loss through extreme measures since they really want to see the changes, unaware of the scientific approach to sustainable fat loss. My goal is to correct these misconceptions and show them that they donâ€™t have to starve themselves to achieve their goals, and help anxious people to fight against their struggles.  

To ensure relevance, I incorporated real experiences from my friends and online discussions, highlighting the content itself and people's struggles from different aspects, such as money spent, amount of attempts, and popular methods. To make people better understand and engage, I also created two personas representing different lifestyles, demonstrating how they could achieve fat loss in a smart way.  

To improve accessibility, I avoided technical jargon, and used engaging visuals with short explanations and transitions. Then I balanced data-driven insights with relatable examples. This makes the project more **reader-friendly and applicable to everyday life**.  


## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.
