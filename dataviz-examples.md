# Data visualization examples
_You can place some of your data viz examples from the course here.  Make sure to include any citations / references / data sources used, and it's probably a good idea to explain what these visualizations show._

## Assignment 1: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension.

**-Explanation of My Final Redesign-**

When I first looked at the dataset, I was overwhelmed by the number of countries and years it covered.   I knew I needed to narrow it down to something more focused.   So, I decided to analyze North America, which includes the United States, Canada, and Mexico. These three countries not only share a geographic region but also represent distinct economic scales and fiscal policies.   Comparing them felt like an interesting way to showcase their similarities and differences over time.

For the redesign, I specifically chose the years 2003 to 2013 because first of all, it's a decade so it will be fun to see what change happened in this decade, and also this period includes significant economic events like the 2008 financial crisis (I only know the name and time of this incident). So I wanted to see how government debt levels changed during this time and whether each country had similar trends. The line chart format was an easy decision because itâ€™s perfect for showing changes over time. Compared to the heatmap I created in Part 2, the line chart feels much more dynamic and tells a clearer story about trends and relationships.

In terms of design, each country has its own color, making it easy to follow their individual trail. I also labeled the axes clearly and used a meaningful title to ensure that the chart stands alone without needing too much extra context.

**-Why This Chart Works-**

The line chart allows viewers to instantly grasp the differences in debt levels between these three countries. For example, the U.S. debt levels show a dramatic spike after 2008, likely reflecting its response to the financial crisis. Canadaâ€™s debt, on the other hand, grew at a steadier rate. Meanwhile, Mexicoâ€™s debt levels remained significantly lower, highlighting the differences in the countryâ€™s management.

Compared to the heatmap, which felt a bit static, this chart is more direct and intuitive. The heatmap was helpful for comparing multiple countries at once, but it lacked the ability to highlight trends over time.

**-My Thought Process-**

I wanted to create a visualization that was both informative and easy to read. Once I landed on the line chart, it all started to work. Iâ€™m really happy with how it turned out, and I hope others find it as interesting as I do!  
(First try on Tableau was a disasterðŸ«¢ but I'm happy I can figure it out and start to create on my ownðŸ˜Ž)
