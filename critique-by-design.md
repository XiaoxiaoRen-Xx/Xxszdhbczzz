# Title
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: The original data visualization

_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

The data visualization I chose comes from Visual Capitalist, which shows the top 10 countries for global military spending in 2021. The original visualization can be found here, and in the text section it also presents data for the top five countries in global military spending from 2017 to 2021:

ðŸ”— [Visual Capitalist - Top 10 Countries by Military Spending (2021)](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-top-10-countries-by-military-spending/)

What initially attracted me to this visualization was its outstanding visual design. It uses an army green tone with a toy soldier pattern, which not only reminds people of the military theme at a glance, but is also very visually appealing. Even without looking at the title, the audience can quickly understand the message of this chart through these elements - it is related to the military. I have to admit that from a Visual Storytelling point of view, the design is a success.
However, when I took a closer look at this visualization, I found some obvious problems. These questions made me realize that while the chart does a good job of engaging viewers, it still has a lot of room for improvement in the clarity and accuracy of its messaging. And these deficiencies are exactly what I want to optimize through redesign. I will explain in detail the problems I have found and what I can do to improve them.

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

### Why Did I Choose This Visualization?  

I picked this chart because itâ€™s visually striking and instantly screams military spending with its green tones and toy soldier elements. Itâ€™s engaging, but that strong aesthetic comes at a costâ€”readability takes a hit.  

### Whatâ€™s Not Working?  

- **Hard to compare numbers**  
  The irregular pie chart shapes make it tricky to compare spending across countries. Japan, South Korea, and Germany have similar budgets, but their section sizes feel off, which could mislead viewers.  

- **Ranking gets lost due to design**  
  The chart does rank military spending from highest to lowest, but the numbers are small and easy to miss. A good visualization should make hierarchy obviousâ€”this one doesnâ€™t.  

- **"Rest of the World" Feels unclear and unnecessary**  
  This section doesnâ€™t add much value. Itâ€™s vague about which countries are included and might just distract from the main story.  

- **Too many decorations cause not enough clarity**  
  The toy soldier graphics and 3D effects look cool but donâ€™t actually help people understand the data. Instead, they clutter the chart and make it harder to read.  

**Bottom line:** Great aesthetics, but at the cost of clarity. A cleaner, more intuitive design would make the data much easier to digest.


## Step three: Sketch a solution



## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions: 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- I'm a bit worried that after my redesign, the chart might become somewhat dull, or called less attractive to look at. The original data visualization is actually quite engaging and interesting.
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Is there anything else that might want to be added? I'm welcome to every comment!

Results: 

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Can you tell me what you think this is?  | I can tell it's the world's top 5 countries in military spending from 2017-2021. | Same.  | Yeah, the topic and story are quite straightforward and obvious to me.  |
| Can you describe to me what this is telling you?  | I can see the differences between these 5 countries in a very clear way, no matter in split bars or line charts. | Same. And the US really stands out. | Yeah, both of the visualizations are clear to me and I can tell the same things as they just mentioned.  |
| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?  | The overall structure is good, but I can tell there were no very dramatic and significant changes these years, so I will be thinking you can just put the data for only one year. | I actually hold a different opinion because the data over the past five years clearly shows a trend, which helps the audience understand the pattern. | Yeah, it really depends on what kind of story you want to tell, so of course the split bars and line charts both work for me and I will probably not prefer just only look at the data for only one year.  |
| Who do you think is the intended audience for this?  | For the military enthusiast? Like my dad? haha   | Yeah, same.  | Yes, the first one that comes into my mind is military fans.  |
| I'm a bit worried that after my redesign, the chart might become somewhat dull, or called less attractive to look at. The original data visualization is actually quite engaging and interesting. *I haven't shown them the original design.*  | No! Don't worry about it at all cuz as long as you tell the information and the story you want to tell, then it's 100% fine! I don't want to look at a "good-looking" chart and gain nothing useful info from that. | Yes! 100% agree!  | Same!  |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently?  | Not that much because I already see the two different options you made for the redesign and I think both of them work! It really depends on what story you want to tell and then choose the right one. | Yes, but I still want to call back to my first thought that maybe you can just put the data for 2017 and 2021 or just one year is also fine because for me the changes are not that unexpected. But I also can get the thought of you want to show the trend so great job still! | Same! My only concern is for the countries For countries with very similar data, their lines overlapping and getting tangled together might be something I need to think through more carefully. You might want to reconsider or try a different way to present it. |
| Is there anything else that might want to be added? I'm welcome to every comment!  | And actually I have another ideaâ€”what if we compare the percentage of each country's military spending relative to its annual budget? I think that would also be a great point to consider but I do not know the original data so I just saying this perspective can be also fun to look at. | Oh good catch! But it might need more data.  | Yeah, so true.  |


Synthesis/ Key Takeaways!

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

- Some people think the five-year data doesnâ€™t change much, so keeping just one year would be clearer; others believe the trend matters, it all really depends on the story you want to tell. 
- Donâ€™t worry about the chart being too simple that everyone agrees that clarity is the big key! No one wants a flashy chart with no real insights.  
- Overlapping lines in the line chart might be frustrating; maybe tweaking colors, styles, or trying different kinds of charts to see which is the best can be helped!
- Comparing military spending as a percentage of the annual budget sounds intriguingâ€”if the data allows, it could be a great addition, but remember to focus on the story I want to tell so do the reduction or addition wisely!



## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
