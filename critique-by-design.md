**HiiiüòÑ! How are you doing?**
**Welcome to my critique by design task! I picked a very interesting data visualization and I tried to make some improvement on this.
Feel free to leave comments and suggestions! Hope you enjoy seeing the whole process of my REDESIGN!**

## üîçSTEP ONE: The original data visualization

_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

The data visualization I chose comes from Visual Capitalist, which shows the top 10 countries for global military spending in 2021. The original visualization can be found here, and in the text section it also presents data for the top five countries in global military spending from 2017 to 2021:

What initially attracted me to this visualization was its outstanding visual design. It uses an army green tone with a toy soldier pattern, which not only reminds people of the military theme at a glance, but is also very visually appealing. Even without looking at the title, the audience can quickly understand the message of this chart through these elements - it is related to the military. I have to admit that from a Visual Storytelling point of view, the design is a success.
However, when I took a closer look at this visualization, I found some obvious problems. These questions made me realize that while the chart does a good job of engaging viewers, it still has a lot of room for improvement in the clarity and accuracy of its messaging. And these deficiencies are exactly what I want to optimize through redesign. I will explain in detail the problems I have found and what I can do to improve them.

## üßêSTEP TWO: the critique

### Why Did I Choose This Visualization?  

I picked this chart because it‚Äôs visually striking and instantly screams military spending with its green tones and toy soldier elements. It‚Äôs engaging, but that strong aesthetic comes at a cost‚Äîreadability takes a hit.  

### What‚Äôs Not Working?  

- **Hard to compare numbers**  
  The irregular pie chart shapes make it tricky to compare spending across countries. Japan, South Korea, and Germany have similar budgets, but their section sizes feel off, which could mislead viewers.  

- **Ranking gets lost due to design**  
  The chart does rank military spending from highest to lowest, but the numbers are small and easy to miss. A good visualization should make hierarchy obvious‚Äîthis one doesn‚Äôt.  

- **"Rest of the World" part feels unclear and unnecessary**  
  This section doesn‚Äôt add much value. It‚Äôs vague about which countries are included and might just distract from the main story.  

- **Too many decorations cause not enough clarity**  
  The toy soldier graphics and 3D effects look cool but don‚Äôt actually help people understand the data. Instead, they clutter the chart and make it harder to read.

## üéôÔ∏èSTEP FOUR: Test the solution

**Questions:**

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
-Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- I'm a bit worried that after my redesign, the chart might become somewhat dull, or called less attractive to look at. The original data visualization is actually quite engaging and interesting.
- Is there anything else that might want to be added? I'm welcome to every comment!

**Interviewers:**

- student, Master of Science in Public Policy and Management, early 20's
- student, Master of Entertainment Industry Management, late 20's
- student, Master of Art Management, early 20's

**Results:**

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Can you tell me what you think this is?  | I can tell it's the world's top 5 countries in military spending from 2017-2021. | Same.  | Yeah, the topic and story are quite straightforward and obvious to me.  |
| Can you describe to me what this is telling you?  | I can see the differences between these 5 countries in a very clear way, no matter in split bars or line charts. | Same. And the US really stands out. | Yeah, both of the visualizations are clear to me and I can tell the same things as they just mentioned.  |
| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?  | The overall structure is good, but I can tell there were no very dramatic and significant changes these years, so I will be thinking you can just put the data for only one year. | I actually hold a different opinion because the data over the past five years clearly shows a trend, which helps the audience understand the pattern. | Yeah, it really depends on what kind of story you want to tell, so of course the split bars and line charts both work for me and I will probably not prefer just only look at the data for only one year.  |
| Who do you think is the intended audience for this?  | For the military enthusiast? Like my dad? haha   | Yeah, same.  | Yes, the first one that comes into my mind is military fans.  |
| I'm a bit worried that after my redesign, the chart might become somewhat dull, or called less attractive to look at. The original data visualization is actually quite engaging and interesting. *I haven't shown them the original design.*  | No! Don't worry about it at all cuz as long as you tell the information and the story you want to tell, then it's 100% fine! I don't want to look at a "good-looking" chart and gain nothing useful info from that. | Yes! 100% agree!  | Same! A good or professional chart doesn't mean it has a complicated or "funny "design! |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently?  | Not that much because I already see the two different options you made for the redesign and I think both of them work! It really depends on what story you want to tell and then choose the right one. | Yes, but I still want to call back to my first thought that maybe you can just put the data for 2017 and 2021 or just one year is also fine because for me the changes are not that unexpected. But I also can get the thought of you want to show the trend so great job still! | Same! My only concern is for the countries For countries with very similar data, their lines overlapping and getting tangled together might be something I need to think through more carefully. You might want to reconsider or try a different way to present it. |
| Is there anything else that might want to be added? I'm welcome to every comment!  | And actually I have another idea‚Äîwhat if we compare the percentage of each country's military spending relative to its annual budget? I think that would also be a great point to consider but I do not know the original data so I just saying this perspective can be also fun to look at. | Oh good catch! But it might need more data.  | Yeah, so true.  |

**Synthesis**

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

- Some people think the five-year data doesn‚Äôt change much, so keeping just one year would be clearer; others believe the trend matters, it all really depends on the story you want to tell. 
- Don‚Äôt worry about the chart being too simple that everyone agrees that clarity is the big key! No one wants a flashy chart with no real insights.  
- Overlapping lines in the line chart might be frustrating; maybe tweaking colors, styles, or trying different kinds of charts to see which is the best can be helped!
- Comparing military spending as a percentage of the annual budget sounds intriguing‚Äîif the data allows, it could be a great addition, but remember to focus on the story I want to tell so do the reduction or addition wisely!



## üí°STEP FIVE: build the solution

**My Final Thoughts and Key Improvements:**

- Better Data Readability
  The original irregular pie chart made comparisons difficult. Switching to split bars ensures a clear, accurate representation of each country‚Äôs military spending.
  I ultimately decided against using a line chart because India, the UK, and Russia's lines overlapped too much, making it messy and hard to read. While line charts are great for showing trends, clarity always comes first, and this one just wasn‚Äôt cutting it.
   Instead of using national flags, I assigned distinct colors to each country, making it easier for viewers to recognize them at a glance.

- Clearer Information Hierarchy
  Direct value labels inside the bars eliminate the need for viewers to search for numbers, making the data more accessible.
  The structured layout and design reduce the attraction of unnecessary items, allowing for quicker and easier interpretation.

- More Meaningful Insights
  Unlike the original, which only showed data for 2021, my version highlights trends over time (2017-2021), helping viewers see which countries have ramped up or maintained their spending.

## AI acknowledgements

1. Post-Monday Interview Reflections: After our Monday interview, my teammates brought up some fresh perspectives that were actually quite different from my initial thoughts. This made me seriously question my own judgment. Even though I was tempted to change my approach, I still felt strongly about my original idea. So, I turned to ChatGPT‚Äînot for answers, but more for a sanity check. I explained my reasoning, we went back and forth a bit, and in the end, I decided to stick to my gut. (AI didn‚Äôt contribute to my work, but it did give me some emotional supportü§£!)  

2. Fixing the Image Display Issue: I kept running into this weird problem where my images would show up just fine in the preview but wouldn‚Äôt appear on my portfolio webpage. I asked ChatGPT for help, and it pointed out that I needed to adjust the image links to the correct raw format. After making the fix, everything worked perfectly!  

3. Tableau Instructions: While working with Tableau, I had a few roadblocks while creating my charts, so I asked ChatGPT for guidance on some technical aspects. However, in the end, I decided not to use Tableau for my final visualization.  

4. Help out with my writingÔºÅ: In Step 5, I wanted to make my explanations clearer and more concise. ChatGPT helped refine my wording, ensuring that my points were more precise and impactful.
