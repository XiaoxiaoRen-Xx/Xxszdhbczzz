_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

The data visualization I chose comes from Visual Capitalist, which shows the top 10 countries for global military spending in 2021. The original visualization can be found here, and in the text section it also presents data for the top five countries in global military spending from 2017 to 2021:

ðŸ”— [Visual Capitalist - Top 10 Countries by Military Spending (2021)](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-top-10-countries-by-military-spending/)

What initially attracted me to this visualization was its outstanding visual design. It uses an army green tone with a toy soldier pattern, which not only reminds people of the military theme at a glance, but is also very visually appealing. Even without looking at the title, the audience can quickly understand the message of this chart through these elements - it is related to the military. I have to admit that from a Visual Storytelling point of view, the design is a success.
However, when I took a closer look at this visualization, I found some obvious problems. These questions made me realize that while the chart does a good job of engaging viewers, it still has a lot of room for improvement in the clarity and accuracy of its messaging. And these deficiencies are exactly what I want to optimize through redesign. I will explain in detail the problems I have found and what I can do to improve them.

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

#### Why Did I Choose This Visualization?

I selected this visualization for a few key reasons:  

1. **Visually Appealing with a Strong Thematic Representation**  
   - The use of military green tones and toy soldier elements immediately reinforces the theme of military spending, making the chart visually engaging and easy to associate with its topic.  
   - The strong visual storytelling helps draw viewers in, allowing them to quickly grasp the context of the data.  
   - However, the heavy emphasis on aesthetics comes at the cost of readability, as the visual elements might distract viewers from the actual data.  

2. **Despite Its Engaging Design, Several Issues Hinder Data Readability and Accuracy**  

   a: Difficult to Make Precise Comparisons
     - The chart uses a modified pie chart format, where each countryâ€™s spending is represented by **irregularly shaped sections**. This makes it difficult for viewers to accurately compare military expenditures across countries.  
     - The proportions are not entirely intuitiveâ€”for instance, Japan, South Korea, and Germany have similar spending figures, yet their segment sizes appear inconsistent. This could lead to misinterpretation of the actual differences between countries.  

   b: Ranking Information Is Not Clearly Highlighted  
     - While the chart is sorted by military spending from highest to lowest, **the ranking numbers are too small and not emphasized**, making them hard to spot at a glance.  
     - According to Stephen Fewâ€™s Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile, a well-designed visualization should clearly present hierarchical information, which this chart fails to do effectively.  

   c: The "Rest of the World" Section Could Be Misleading 
     - The chart includes a "Rest of the World" category, but this section does not add meaningful context to the story. Instead, it may distract or confuse viewers by:  
       - Lacking transparencyâ€”it does not specify which countries are included in this category.  
       - Not contributing to the main messageâ€”viewers might focus on this section, only to realize it provides little useful information.  

   d: Excessive Decorative Elements Interfere with Information Clarity
     - While the toy soldier graphics enhance visual appeal, they do not improve data readability and may actually distract from the key insights.  
     - The heavy use of gradients, shadows, and 3D effects complicates the data presentation, reducing overall clarity.  
     - As highlighted in *Good Charts*, effective visualizations should minimize unnecessary decorations, ensuring that viewers can quickly grasp the key information without being overwhelmed by visual noise.  



## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- I'm a bit worried that after my redesign, the chart might become somewhat dull. The original data visualization is actually quite engaging and interesting.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Can you tell me what you think this is?  | I can tell it's the world's top 5 countries in military spending from 2017-2021. | Same.  | Yeah, the topic and story are quite straightforward and obvious to me.  |
| Can you describe to me what this is telling you?  | I can see the differences between these 5 countries in a very clear way, no matter in split bars or line charts. | Same. And the US really stands out. | Yeah, both of the visualizations are clear to me and I can tell the same things as they just mentioned.  |
| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?  | The overall structure is good, but I can tell there were no very dramatic and significant changes these years, so I will be thinking you can just put the data for only one year. | I actually hold a different opinion because the data over the past five years clearly shows a trend, which helps the audience understand the pattern. | Yeah, it really depends on what kind of story you want to tell, so of course the split bars and line charts both work for me and I will probably not prefer just only look at the data for only one year.  |
| Who do you think is the intended audience for this?  | For the military enthusiast? Like my dad? haha   | Yeah, same.  | Yes, the first one that comes into my mind is military fans.  |
| I'm a bit worried that after my redesign, the chart might become somewhat dull. The original data visualization is actually quite engaging and interesting. *I haven't shown them the original design.*  | No! Don't worry about it at all cuz as long as you tell the information and the story you want to tell, then it's 100% fine! I don't want to look at a "good-looking" chart and gain nothing useful info from that. | Yes! 100% agree!  | Same!  |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently?  | Not that much because I already see the two different options you made for the redesign and I think both of them work! It really depends on what story you want to tell and then choose the right one. | Yes, but I still want to call back to my first thought that maybe you can just put the data for 2017 and 2021 or just one year is also fine because for me the changes are not that unexpected. But I also can get the thought of you want to show the trend so great job still! | Same! My only concern is for the countries For countries with very similar data, their lines overlapping and getting tangled together might be something I need to think through more carefully. You might want to reconsider or try a different way to present it. |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

depends on what story I want to tell, I need to do the reduction on data interpretation
if there are no dramatic changes, maybe just keeping the data for one year will be clear enough
focus on proportion or just the amount of money will lead to different chart type choice
don't be afraid of a simple or just called boring chart, a clear and straightforwad chart is always welcomed



## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
