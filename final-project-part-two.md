# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 


## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

### Target Audience & User Research Plan

**a. The Target Audience I Hope to Reach out**

My target audience consists of individuals with very little knowledge of scientific weight loss and fitness. Their understanding of weight loss primarily comes from social media, short videos, and online articles. 

Typically, they:
- Seek rapid weight loss results (hoping to see significant weight changes in a short time)
- Focus on losing weight rather than fat (without considering the impact on health and sustainability)
- Rely on mixed and often misleading information (e.g., "cutting all carbs is the only way to lose weight," "eating only fruits will help you slim down")
- Lack of scientific guidance (do not understand concepts like calorie balance, basal metabolic rate, or nutrient distribution)

Most common categories
- College students or young professionals who aim to lose weight quickly due to social or self-image concerns
- People who have tried multiple weight loss methods but failed to see sustainable results
- Individuals influenced by social media trends who are open to science-based insights but may struggle to differentiate between reliable and misleading information

**b. My Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals to Interview**

- Social media & online communities: Find individuals who have previous posts or often follow the loss weight trend on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or WhatsApp.
- Friends, classmates, and neighbors: Reach out to people I know who are considering weight loss.

## Interview script

**ðŸ’¬ Interview Introduction:**

Hi! Thank you for participating in this interview.
I am currently researching how to use data visualization to help people better understand healthy and effective weight loss.
Your experiences and feedback will help me refine my visualizations to make them easier to understand and more useful.
The interview will take approximately 10-15 minutes. Your responses will remain anonymous, and you may skip any questions you donâ€™t want to answer.

**ðŸ’¡ Interview Questions:**

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Understand past weight loss attempts and information sources.   |        What weight loss methods have you tried before? Follow-up: Where did you learn about these methods? (Social media? Friends? Other sources?)         |
|   Identify key motivations and concerns.   |        What are your biggest concerns when it comes to weight loss? Follow-up: What do you most want to know? (e.g., "How long will it take?" "What should I eat?"         |
|   Assess trust in online weight loss information.   |        Do you think the weight loss information you come across is accurate? Why or why not?          |
|   Rate the awareness of nutrition tracking and interest in visual guidance.   |        Do you think itâ€™s important to track daily macronutrient intake (carbs, protein, fat)? Have you ever calculated it?          |
|   Determine if a simple table or chart would improve their understanding.   |         Would you find it helpful to see a simple table or chart explaining your daily nutritional needs?          |
|   Assess interest in interactive or tailored recommendations.   |        Would you be interested in using a chart to check a personalized weight loss plan for your body situation? Why or why not?          |
|   Gather open-ended feedback   |        Do you have any suggestions for improving this project?          |

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What weight loss methods have you tried before? Follow-up: Where did you learn about these methods? (Social media? Friends? Other sources?)  |      Eat less! I mean less sugar, cake and fried chicken.       |      Excercise and diet (not toxic)       |      Diet for sure, I don't like sweating and exercise.       |
|           Where did you learn about these methods?              |       Well, it's like common sense to eat less and do exercise more.        |      Social media told me to do so, and those people really just eat a cucumber and a cup of coffee I literally can't not.       |       Yeah, I don't know where I learned that but I just knew it since I was a teenager.      |
|            What are your biggest concerns when it comes to weight loss?              |               The time! This takes to see results is very important to me. I really care about whether my efforts yield feedback. However, I usually can't persist long enough to see the results.                 |      Time, but I'm talking about the time for doing exercise.        |      I'm honestly someone with zero patience and no perseveranceâ€”I just can't stick with things.       |
|         Do you think the weight loss information you come across is accurate? Why or why not?                |           I havenâ€™t been paying much attention latelyâ€”just too exhausted. Losing weight isnâ€™t on my mind right now.                     |      Yeah same       |      Well, I used to believe the information I saw was well-founded. But with more and more content relying on over-the-top exaggeration just to grab attention, Iâ€™m starting to question everything.       |
|           Would you find it helpful to see a simple table or chart explaining your daily nutritional needs?              |       Oh yeah sure. My only problem is that when I see "100g of beef," I have no idea how much that actually is. Itâ€™s way too abstract for me, and giving me measurements like that just kills my motivation.                          |      Yeah exactly the same thought. If they could provide real-life examples, like "about the size of a fist" or "the size of your palm," it would make things so much easierâ€”especially for people like me who have zero experience and donâ€™t want the hassle of buying a scale.       |      Can't agree more.       |
|           Would you be interested in using a chart to check a personalized weight loss plan for your body situation? Why or why not?              |               Why not?!                 |      Yes! please make it easy to look at!       |      Agree!       |
|           Do you have any suggestions for improving this project?              |              I think you're on the right track! Just tell your story in a logical way and tell whatever you want to convey.                  |      Yes! I think this will be super great project!       |      Yes!       |
