# Wireframes / storyboards

**I did my storyboard on Shorthand directly.**

I have finished most of my data visualizations and the whole outline for my story you can click the link below to check my project preview!
I kept a few sections after my original work just in case I want to use them later, hope it won't interrupt!

# User research 

**⚠️❗️IMPORTANT INFORMATION**


I conducted **TWO** rounds of interviews for this project. 
The first round focused on understanding my original target audience, allowing me to refine my storytelling approach and structure before creating the draft. -- I did it during the Monday class with my critique group.
The second round gathered feedback from individuals who reviewed my initial draft, helping me evaluate its clarity and effectiveness. -- I did it with my friends.

## Target audience 


### 💪Original Group - Target Audience & User Research Plan💪

**The Original Target Audience I Hope to Reach Out**

My project target audience consists of individuals with very little knowledge of scientific weight loss and fitness. Their understanding of weight loss primarily comes from social media, short videos, and online articles. 

Typically, they:
- Seek rapid weight loss results (hoping to see significant weight changes in a short time)
- Focus on losing weight rather than fat (without considering the impact on health and sustainability)
- Rely on mixed and often misleading information (e.g., "cutting all carbs is the only way to lose weight," "eating only cucumber will help you slim down")
- Lack of scientific guidance (do not understand concepts like input balance)

Most common categories
- College students or professionals who aim to lose weight quickly due to social or self-image concerns
- People who have tried multiple weight loss methods but failed to see sustainable results
- Individuals influenced by social media trends who are open to science-based insights but may struggle to differentiate between reliable and misleading information

**My Approach to Identifying Representative Individuals to Interview**

- Social media & online communities: Find individuals who have previous posts or often follow the loss weight trend on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or WhatsApp.
- Friends, family, classmates, and neighbors: Reach out to people I know who are considering weight loss.

#### Interviewers:

- student, early 20's
- student, late 20's

**💬 Interview Introduction:**

Hi! Thank you for participating in this interview.
I am currently researching how to use data visualization to help people better understand healthy and effective weight loss.
Your experiences and feedback will help me refine my visualizations to make them easier to understand and more useful.
The interview will take approximately 10-15 minutes. Your responses will remain anonymous, and you may skip any questions you don’t want to answer.


**💡 Interview Questions:**

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Understand past weight loss attempts and information sources.   |        What weight loss methods have you tried before? Follow-up: Where did you learn about these methods? (Social media? Friends? Other sources?)         |
|   Identify key motivations and concerns.   |        What are your biggest concerns when it comes to weight loss? Follow-up: What do you most want to know? (e.g., "How long will it take?" "What should I eat?"         |
|   Assess trust in online weight loss information.   |        Do you think the weight loss information you come across is accurate? Why or why not?          |
|   Rate the awareness of nutrition tracking and interest in visual guidance.   |        Do you think it’s important to track daily macronutrient intake (carbs, protein, fat)? Have you ever calculated it?          |
|   Determine if a simple table or chart would improve their understanding.   |         Would you find it helpful to see a simple table or chart explaining your daily nutritional needs?          |
|   Assess interest in interactive or tailored recommendations.   |        Would you be interested in using a chart to check a personalized weight loss plan for your body situation? Why or why not?          |
|   Gather open-ended feedback   |        Do you have any suggestions for improving this project?          |

| Questions               | Interview 1  | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What weight loss methods have you tried before? Follow-up: Where did you learn about these methods? (Social media? Friends? Other sources?)  |      Eat less! I mean less sugar, cake and fried chicken.       |      Excercise and diet (not toxic)       |      Diet for sure, I don't like sweating and exercise.       |
|           Where did you learn about these methods?              |       Well, it's like common sense to eat less and do exercise more.        |      Social media told me to do so, and those people really just eat a cucumber and a cup of coffee I literally can't not.       |       Yeah, I don't know where I learned that but I just knew it since I was a teenager.      |
|            What are your biggest concerns when it comes to weight loss?              |               The time! This takes to see results is very important to me. I really care about whether my efforts yield feedback. However, I usually can't persist long enough to see the results.                 |      Time, but I'm talking about the time for doing exercise.        |      I'm honestly someone with zero patience and no perseverance—I just can't stick with things.       |
|         Do you think the weight loss information you come across is accurate? Why or why not?                |           I haven’t been paying much attention lately—just too exhausted. Losing weight isn’t on my mind right now.                     |      Yeah same       |      Well, I used to believe the information I saw was well-founded. But with more and more content relying on over-the-top exaggeration just to grab attention, I’m starting to question everything.       |
|           Would you find it helpful to see a simple table or chart explaining your daily nutritional needs?              |       Oh yeah sure. My only problem is that when I see "100g of beef," I have no idea how much that actually is. It’s way too abstract for me, and giving me measurements like that just kills my motivation.                          |      Yeah exactly the same thought. If they could provide real-life examples, like "about the size of a fist" or "the size of your palm," it would make things so much easier—especially for people like me who have zero experience and don’t want the hassle of buying a scale.       |      Can't agree more.       |
|           Would you be interested in using a chart to check a personalized weight loss plan for your body situation? Why or why not?              |               Why not?!                 |      Yes! please make it easy to look at!       |      Agree!       |
|           Do you have any suggestions for improving this project?              |              I think you're on the right track! Just tell your story in a logical way and tell whatever you want to convey.                  |      Yes! I think this will be super great project!       |      Yes!       |

**Findings so far:**

1️⃣ Most people rely on dieting over exercise and learn weight loss methods from social media, though many now question its reliability.

2️⃣ There are many concerns—whether it’s the time required to see results or the time needed for exercise. Lack of patience makes consistency difficult.

3️⃣ Abstract food measurements (e.g., "100g of beef") are confusing—participants prefer real-life size references like "fist-sized" portions.

4️⃣ A simple, visual chart for daily nutrition and a personalized weight loss plan would be very helpful, but it should be easy to read and visually engaging.

5️⃣ Keep the storytelling logical and structured.

**💡 Interview Questions:**

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Ensure the key takeaway is clear.    |      What do you think is the main message of this project?            |
|   Identify strengths and areas needing improvement.   |      Did any part of the story feel particularly engaging or confusing?           |

|   Get actionable improvement suggestions.   |       If you could change one thing about this project, what would it be?           |


**Interview Answers and Findings**
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|      What do you think is the main message of this project?                   |       That quick and toxic diet doesn’t last. I used to believe in extreme diets, but your charts changed my view.      |      Extreme diets don’t work, and most people regain weight. You do a great job proving it with data.      |     Yes, the message is strong enough.        |
|           Did any part of the story feel particularly engaging or confusing              |     Maybe a title slide before each part would make it stand out more.        |     Loved the part about diet myths. But a smoother transition between sections would help the flow.       |        The visual breakdown of diet failures was eye-opening. I just wasn’t sure how one part led to the next     |
|       Have you encountered misleading weight loss advice before? Did this project challenge or reinforce your views?                  |  All the time! I once followed a ‘no carbs’ rule just because I saw it on a post.           |      Meal replacement shakes or energy bars.      |      Cucumber and coffee theory, I really saw this one time.       |
|          Did the charts and graphs help you understand the key points               |      Yes, they made the message clearer. Maybe just add a short lead-in before each chart.       |      They’re great! But one or two felt sudden—if there were short explanations between them, it’d be perfect.      |       I’d just love a quick sentence explaining why it’s important.       |
|          Was there any data visualization that felt unclear or unnecessary?               |      Most of them are clear for me so far, but some could use a little more introduction or details. Especially for one page, the data may change the layout or type to make it more clear.       |      I believe the charts in the later part are the big challenges for you but you're on the right track.      |     Yes, I can foresee the chart to show personalized information will be challenging.        |
|            If you could change one thing, what would it be?             |       More section dividers—title slides would make it flow better      |      Pay more attention on storytelling and make it logical!      |      Maybe a quick recap at the end of each section, like ‘Key Takeaways’       |

|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Participants want a clearer structure with section dividers. |Add title slides before major sections to improve storytelling flow.
| Transitions between sections need to be smoother and more logical.                                         |      Add brief transition sentences to connect different parts more clearly.                                                                           |
|  Data visualizations are effective but some of them need context or change the chart type.                                       |     Think more about how to interpret data accurately and effectively. Insert one-liner explanations before each chart to provide context.                                                                            |
|          The later charts may be challenging to interpret.                                |   Pay extra attention to simplifying complex charts and ensuring readability.                                                                              |
|     Participants suggest a "Key Takeaways" section.       |              Add a recap section at the end of each part for better information retention.                                                                   |
|            |                                                                                 |

- I still had ChatGPT help me refine and reorganize my language, especially when drafting my interview script. I realized that my questions were not productive or entirely accurate, so I sought help to make them more direct and concise.

- When selecting my two target audiences, I noticed that my thinking was somewhat rigid. ChatGPT helped me explore more options, such as expanding to *people who have been exposed to online viral weight loss trends* and the *general audience*, also *Focus on losing weight rather than fat (without considering the impact on health and sustainability)* also inspired by AI

- For the shorthand structure, when I got stuck on how to connect my storytelling smoothly, I asked ChatGPT for guidance on transitions and to check whether my logic was coherent.
