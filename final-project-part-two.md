# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

### Target Audience & User Research Plan

**a. The Target Audience I Hope to Reach out**

My target audience consists of individuals with very little knowledge of scientific weight loss and fitness. Their understanding of weight loss primarily comes from social media, short videos, and online articles. 

Typically, they:
- Seek rapid weight loss results (hoping to see significant weight changes in a short time)
- Focus on losing weight rather than fat (without considering the impact on health and sustainability)
- Rely on mixed and often misleading information (e.g., "cutting all carbs is the only way to lose weight," "eating only fruits will help you slim down")
- Lack of scientific guidance (do not understand concepts like calorie balance, basal metabolic rate, or nutrient distribution)

Most common categories
- College students or young professionals who aim to lose weight quickly due to social or self-image concerns
- People who have tried multiple weight loss methods but failed to see sustainable results
- Individuals influenced by social media trends who are open to science-based insights but may struggle to differentiate between reliable and misleading information
